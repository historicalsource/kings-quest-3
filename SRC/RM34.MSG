"A couple of chickens strut about their chicken coop. As all chickens
 do, they peck, scratch, and cluck. The poor things; they will end up

%message	22
"Tucking the chicken firmly under one arm, you gently pluck a small
 feather, then let it go."

%message	23

%message	31

"\"The poor boy,\" clucks one of the hens. \"He thinks his name
 is Gwydion.\""

%message	34
"\"Wouldn't he be surprised to find out he's a prince!\" replies the other
 hen."

%message	35
"\"Yes,\" cackles the first hen. \"He's really Prince Alexander.\""

%message	36
"You hear one chicken say to the other, \"I feel so sorry for the
 boy. The old wizard treats him miserably.\""

 own neck. Look at the situation WE'RE in.\""

%message	38
"\"Remember Gertrude,\" one of the chickens reminisces.
 \"Remember how one day the old wizard came out and got her.\""

%message	39
"\"Oh, I know,\" clucks the other. \"It was horrible! I hear she ended
 up in his stew. I can't bear to think about it!\" "

%message	40
"You overhear one of the hens speaking to the other, \"Whatever
 happened to your last batch of chicks, my dear?\""

%message	41
"Answers the other, \"My poor babies were doing so well! I was just
 teaching them the proper methods of scratching when that old
 rascal came out and took them away!\""

%message	42
"\"Where do you think he took them?\" wondered the first hen."

%message	43
"\"I hate to think,\" the distraught mother hen replies. \"I just
 heard them peeping as they were carried off.\""
