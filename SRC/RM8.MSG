"This is where Manannan eats his meals. You, of course, are not supposed
 to eat here. YOU eat in the kitchen. There is a pine table
 and benches large enough to seat at least ten people; but the wizard has
 never HAD any guests for dinner."

%message	2
"He seems to be quite hungry."

%message	3
"The large dining table is made of pine planking.
 Matching benches run its length on both sides. The
 table is big enough to seat at least ten people."

%message	4
"There is nothing on the dining table. You keep it very clean as
 Manannan will not eat on a dirty table."

%message	5
"You bend over and peer under the table. You see nothing but
 a few crumbs left over from one of Manannan's meals."

%message	6
"You take a well deserved moment's rest. But, you wonder if
 you have time to be sitting here?"

%message	7
"Mmmmmm! You needed that."

%message	8
"You scrutinize the moosehead very carefully. But, you see
 it is nothing but an old head. You do feel sorry for the poor thing, though."

%message	9
"The moosehead is securely fastened to the wall. You cannot remove it."

%message	10
"Flickering candles from the wrought iron lamp light the room."

%message	11
"There are two doorways here. One leads to the kitchen,
 the other to the entry hall."

%message	12
"Manannan is impatiently waiting for his food! His
 stomach rumbles as he drums his gnarled fingers on the
 table. You'd better feed him quickly, or dire consequences may result."

%message	13
"Manannan is out of sorts right now. \"Don't jabber
 at me, boy! Bring me my food, NOW!\" he bellows."

%message	14
"After speaking to the grouchy wizard again, he narrows
 his bushy-white eyebrows and looks at you with ill-temper. \"You're
 awfully thick-headed, aren't you?\" he snarls. \"It seems you need to be
 taught a lesson or two about OBEYING!\""

%message	15
"You are carrying more than one type of food. Which would you like
 to give the wizard?"

 %message	16
"You place the food on the dining table before the
 hungry wizard. Ravenously, he devours every bit of it."

%message	17
"Evidently, Manannan has important things on his mind."

%message	18
"It's obvious the wizard enjoyed his meal as he lets out a satisfied
 belch. He rises and leaves without so much as a \"Thank you!\""

%message	19
"You have no food to give the wizard."

%message	20
"Oh, Manannan is here! You wonder what mood he's in, as you never
 know from one minute to the next what he will do. To your
 relief, he is preoccupied. He's muttering mumbo-jumbos you don't understand."

%message	21
"There is a little metal cup on the table."

%message	22
"You pick up the little tin cup and carry it with you."

%message	23
"You're too far away."

%message	24
"He doesn't seem to be hungry right now."

%message	25
"Manannan wouldn't like that."

%message	26
"You're too far from the table."

%message	27
"Finish chewing first."

%message	28
"You are standing."

%message	29
"You already took it."

%message	30
"You fooled him! Manannan didn't realize the porridge was tainted,
 and ate the whole bowl!"

%message	31
"You purr contentedly. You will enjoy your new life as a cat!"

%message	32
"He's too busy to reply."

%message	33
"Manannan will never annoy anyone again."

%message	34
"Manannan seems unusually quiet, don't you think!"

%message	35
"You'd better get on with your quest. Manannan is no longer a bother to
 anyone!"

%message	36
"Congratulations! Manannan will never again enslave you or the people
 of Llewdor!! At last, you are free!"
