"You have entered the bandits' hideout; one of them is
 coming after you now!"

%message 2
"You have entered the bandits' hideout; one of them is
 sleeping at a small table."

%message 3
"The hideout is made of rough planks, sparsely furnished with a table, a
 chair, and a small, wooden bin in the corner."

%message 4
"The ugly bandit is dressed in dirty clothes.
 He looks, and smells, as if he hasn't had a bath in months. He has a
 very threatening look in his eyes!"

%message 5
"The scoundrel is fast asleep at the table. He is
 dressed in dirty, ragged clothes, and emits a very unpleasant odor."

%message 6
"There is a leather coin purse lying on top of a wobbly table."

%message 7
"The wobbly, wooden table is made out of rough planks."

%message 8
"You very carefully lift the coin purse off the table; practically out
 from under the sleeping bandit's nose!"

%message 9
"That is not possible!"

%message 10
"This must be where the bandits store their loot! You see all of your
 stolen possessions inside the bin."

%message 11
"There is nothing in the bin."

%message 12
"The shabby, wooden bin is built into a corner of the treehouse. It is
 covered by a hinged lid."

%message 13
"The bin is already open."

%message 14
"You slowly lift the lid, and hope the squeaky hinges do not wake the
 bandit."

%message 15
"He looks pretty big and mean. Perhaps you should run instead."

%message 16
"What kind of person would kill a sleeping man?!"

%message 17
"The bandit opens his eyes and sees you in his hideout. He jumps up from
 the chair and chases you."

%message 18
"You see the limbs and leaves of the tree swaying in the breeze."

%message 19
"Ok."

%message 20
"There is nothing in the bin."

%message 21
"The lid is closed."

%message 22
"You need to be closer."

%message 23
"You see the stained and dirty floor, and through the cracks, between the
 planks, you see the ground far below."

%message 24
"The heartless thug drags you out the door and pushes you off the porch."
