"You have entered the musty tower of the old wizard's
 house. A polished brass telescope is directed out a window. From
 here, Manannan spies upon the poor occupants of Llewdor."

%message	3
"Manannan has the brass telescope pointed out a window.
 It is well polished. He uses the
 telescope to keep tabs on the citizenry of Llewdor."

"You put your eye to the glass. It amazes you how near everything seems.
 You can even see squirrels climbing
 faraway trees. No wonder the wizard knows all activities in
 Llewdor."

%message	5
"There are narrow, steep stairs leading downwards."

%message	6
"You hope Manannan doesn't notice the floor needs sweeping."

%message	7
"You pick up the dead fly and drop it into
 your hand. Disgustedly, you look at it. \"I
 don't want to carry around a dead fly,\" you think. Picking off
 its wings, you throw the rest away."

"You already took it."

%message	9

 It's just too heavy for you."

%message	16
"You see Manannan spying on the poor citizens of
 Llewdor. He grunts, clicks his tongue, and mutters to
 himself. He is spying so intensely, he hasn't noticed you."
