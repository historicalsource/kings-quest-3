"Manannan is very private with his study, and doesn't like you poking around.
 The huge oak desk is
 covered with his writing implements. An oak cabinet is in the
 corner. There is a chart on the rear wall.
 The bookshelves are filled with books on every
 subject; the wizard fancies himself to be quite a scholar."

%message	2
"You already have it."

%message	3
"You are not close enough."

%message	4
"The massive desk is made from oak. The wizard does all of
 his reading, writing, and calculating here."

%message	5
"The desk is covered with the wizard's writing implements: quill pens,
 jars of oak bark ink, and parchment paper. Manannan is a
 prolific writer, recording his many ideas and formulas."

%message	6
"You open the large desk's only drawer; but, you see nothing
 interesting. Before you're caught, you close it."

%message	7
"The oak cabinet has a brass handle on its door. Your feather duster is
 lying on its top."

%message	8
"The chart has no meaning to you."

%message	9
"There is just your feather duster on the cabinet."

%message	10
"You try to turn the handle, but, unfortunately, the door is locked."

%message	11
"Inside, you find the wizard's magic wand."

%message	12
"You unlock the oaken cabinet using the brass key."

%message	13
"You find it is empty."

%message	14
"Carefully examining the bookshelf, you notice a glint of metal
 behind one huge volume."

%message	15
"So many books line the bookshelf, you wonder when Manannan
 has time to read them all. Titles cover many subjects:
 from \"Ancient Arabic Mythology,\" to \"A Study of the Heavens,\" to
 \"The Philosophies of Socrates.\""

%message	16
"After closing the door, you carefully relock it."

%message	17
"You glance at the titles of the books, but do not see any
 that interest you. Wait... was that a glint of metal behind one large book?"

%message	18
"You glance at the books, but see no others that interest you."

%message	19
"You push the large book aside, revealing a metal lever attached to
 the back of the bookshelf."

%message	20
"You move the big book back where you found it so it again conceals
 the metal lever."

%message	21
"Don't you remember... you emptied it yesterday."

%message	22
"The metal lever is attached to the back of the bookshelf."

%message	23
"You look closely at the floor, but do not see any signs of one."

%message	24
"Peering into the dark, frightening trapdoor, you see
 treacherous stone steps."

%message	25
"You take it with you, knowing it could mean death if he finds it missing."

%message	26
"You look everywhere in the room, but do not see a lever."

%message	27
"%m22 You cannot take it."

%message	28
"A trapdoor opens, revealing steep stone steps leading into darkness."

%message	29
"The trapdoor groans shut, disappearing into the floorboards."

%message	30
"The wizard wouldn't appreciate that."

%message	31
"You carefully replace the magic wand exactly as you found it."

%message	32
"Caught in the act! You can see his rage building as the wizard's
 face turns red behind his white beard and his eyes bulge
 alarmingly. He roars at you, \"You know you're not allowed to sneak
 around in my private study!\""

%message	33
"Before you replace the book, you'd better shut the trapdoor."

%message	34
"The wizard is writing at his desk. He looks up from his work,
 and greets you with a scowl. \"Boy, you know I don't like you to enter my
 private study, especially when I'm writing,\" he growls. \"Leave now,
 or I'll make you leave!\""

%message	35
"You don't want the old wizard to grow suspicious of your activities."

%message	36
"There may be something metallic behind that large book."
