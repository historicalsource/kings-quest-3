"%m2 A loud group of seafaring men are drinking rum at the table.
 They are swapping yarns about past voyages. You overhear as they speak of
 setting sail today for a distant land across the ocean."

%message 5
"%m2 Two surly-looking characters are drinking ale at the table. Looking
 closer, you see that they are the bandits from the forest!"

"The sailors have obviously been drinking heavily for some time, and are
 very loud and rowdy!"

%message 9
"The two ruffians at the table see you looking at them, and glare back at you
 menacingly. It's the bandits from the forest!"

%message 10
"The buxom barmaid has an air of hardened determination. You get the feeling
 that she doesn't take any guff from anybody."

%message 11
"You overhear snatches of the two bandits' conversation,
 \"...squirmed jist like a pig. An' that rope ya rigged inside o' that
 big oak tree works great! Now nobody'll 'ere find ar' hideout. Why,
 I'll bet even that wizard...\""

 A good pull o'
 ale, or'd ya rather a dram o' rum? My, aren't ye the han'some one!\""

%message 20
"The barmaid retorts, \"Go on, ya deadbeat. Drinks cost money, ya know!\""

%message 21
"The barmaid hands you a glass, and the potent liquid burns as it slides down
 your parched throat. It hits bottom, and you suddenly feel a bit woozy."

%message 22
"That one tasted even better than the last. Just one more sounds like a good
 idea."

%message 23
"There is nobody here except the pretty barmaid."

%message 24
"Talk to whom?"

%message 25
"The sailors just ignore you."

%message 26
"One of the ugly rogues scowls at you as he says, \"Beat it, kid!\""

%message 27

%message 28
"The sailors peer at you through bleary eyes, and continue swilling their
 rum. One, who looks like the captain, pauses, and drunkenly slurs,
 \"Aye, me bucko, be ya wantin' passage on me ship? Whatcha runnin' from?
 Aw, s'no matter, 's long as ya got gold. Lets me see how much ya got!\""

%message 29
"The drunken sea captain looks angry as he asks again,
 \" Don't ignore me laddie! I asked ya how much gold ya got
 fer passage on me ship?\""

%message 30
"\"Too late bucko,\" the sea captain slurs. \"I ain' in'ersted in ya no more.
 Go pester some'un else.\""

%message 31
"As you bring out the purse, the captain snatches
 it from your hand and says,"

%message 32
"%m31 \"Aye lad, I sees ya do have a wee bit 'o gold. It's less'n me
 reg'lar  fare, but I'll gives ya passage anyways.
 We'll be waitin' fer ya at the wharf, but not fer long.\"
 The captain and his men down their rum in one long
 draught, then leave the tavern."

%message 33
"\"Ya little cheat! Ya've got not a farthing! Ya was tryin' t' weasel
 aboard me ship!! Go on with ya, git outta me sight!\""

%message 34
"%m36 \"What can I do fer ya sir? Can I get ya somethin'? I
 can't spend much time with ya, 'cause I gotta handle these seafarin'
 scoundrels that come inta town t'day.\""

%message 35
"%m36 Without taking her eyes off the two men, she says, \"I'll be happy to
 take yer order, but be quick 'bout it 'cause those two are keepin' me
 hoppin'.\""

%message 36
"\"Keep yer shirts on, ya ornery buzzards,\" the barmaid yells. \"I'll be there quick
 enough!\""

%message 37
"You are too far away."

%message 38
"The two scroungy thieves are dirty and unkempt,
 and their clothes are smelly. Cruelty darkens their faces. These
 look like good people to avoid."

%message 39
"You signal the barmaid, \"I'd like to buy these two gentlemen a round.\""

%message 40
"%m39 When she brings the drinks, you discover that you only have one coin.
 With a look of scorn, she takes your last coin and leaves one drink for the
 two oafs to fight over."

%message 41
"%m39 If ya says so, sir,\" she replies. \"That'll be two gold, if ya please.\"
 The bandits down the drinks with nary a thank you."
