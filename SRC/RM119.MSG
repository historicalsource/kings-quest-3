"Bashfully, you introduce yourself to your long-lost sister. \"How can I
 be sure you're really my brother?\" Princess Rosella wonders. \"I know!
 My mother always said that Alexander had a cute birthmark on his bottom.
 Let me see if you have it.\" 

Embarrassed, you reveal your cute birthmark. \"Oh Alexander!\" she cries,
\"You really ARE back! Mum and Dad will be SOOOOO happy!\""

%message	2
"You ask Rosella about your parents. \"Mum and Dad were heart-broken when
 you disappeared as a baby,\" she explains. \"Dad searched EVERYWHERE for
 you. Obviously, he never found you.\" Pausing, she looks at you
 questioningly. \"By the way, where HAVE you been?\" 

 You explain that you have been living with an evil wizard in the land of
 Llewdor, and that you turned him into a cat by using magic. \"How awful
 for you!\" she exclaims. \"Well, I'm so glad you're back!!\""

%message	3
"You ask Princess Rosella to tell you about Daventry. She replies, \"Hard
 times hit Daventry right after you were kidnapped. Dad and Mum tried,
 but it was like they had lost their will.\" Clenching her fist, Rosella
 continues. \"We were down on our guard, and the terrible dragon came.
 We all thought it was the end.\""

%message	4
"\"I was scared, you know,\" your sister answers. \"But, I DID want to be
 brave. I was hoping my sacrifice might somehow help.\" She brightens a
 bit. \"Maybe, it did. Because of me, YOU came. Now, we're together
 again, and together we can put Daventry right!\""

%message	5
"You comment upon the spoiled scenery of Daventry. Princess Rosella
 looks disgusted as she replies, \"The dragon did all that. He burnt our
 countryside, and we were all terrified to even come out of our houses.
 You don't remember, but it used to be very beautiful.\""

%message	6
"You and Princess Rosella engage in idle pleasantries. You discover that
 your sister is not only beautiful, but very strong-willed and brave.
 You admire that in a woman."

 SOOOOOO happy!!\""

%message	16
"You rapidly untie Princess Rosella from the wooden pole. She looks
 bewildered as to who her benefactor may be.
 \"I'm your long-lost brother, Prince Alexander,\" you proudly exclaim.
 The girl looks doubtful."

%message	17
"You've already untied her."

%message	18
"\"I'll explain it all later,\" you continue, realizing that now is not the
 time for this.
 \"Just follow me. Let's go meet the folks!\" With mixed
 emotions, the girl agrees to follow you."

%message	19
"Princess Rosella is gorgeous! Why, you'd be interested in her if she
 weren't your own sister! Her hair is long, silky, and golden. Her eyes
 are as blue as the bluest sky. Her skin is creamy white. And her BODY...
 well!! Embarrassed, you clear your throat and avert your eyes."

"The girl is securely tied to the stake."
