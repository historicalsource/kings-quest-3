"Averting your eyes, you aim the wizard's hand mirror at Medusa's face. A
 scream pierces the air as she beholds her own hideous reflection...
 then... nothing. You dare to look. Medusa has turned herself to stone!"

"Your eyes fall upon a face so hideous, so gruesome, that the horror of it is
 beyond description. People who look
 upon the face of Medusa, with her hair of writhing, live snakes,
 turn instantly to stone. Suddenly, your body feels cold and
 stiffens hard as a rock. You make a nice statue, Gwydion."

"Oh no! Medusa's touch is like ice! A cold chill shivers down your
 spine, turning to a stiffness that soon hardens your body like a
 rock. You are now nothing but a statue."
