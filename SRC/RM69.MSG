"This gnome looks to be at least a hundred years old. He's stooped with
 age, and his face is as withered as an old prune. Grey, wispy hair
 tops his head, and gnarled hands clutch the chair. As old as he
 looks, however, his twinkling eyes suggest a youthful
 mischievousness as he whistles a merry tune."

 himself, then replies, \"It's about time you got here, lad... I mean,

 \"That monster demanded the sacrifice of your poor sister, Princess
 Rosella, and I'm afraid time is running out. Your parents, the
 King and Queen, are suffering such grief they have locked themselves in
 yon castle and refuse to see anyone.\""

%message	16
"Staring intently at you, the gnome goes on, \"It's up to you, Alexander.
 Your country and family need you. It's written in the wind.\" The
 wizened gnome relaxes and settles back in his chair. He begins
 whistling again."

%message	17
"\"You must hurry, Prince Alexander,\" the old gnome urges. \"Time is
 a-wasting. Go save us.\""

%message	18

"\"Oh YIPPEE! You did it, your majesty!! The gnome squeals in
 delight. \"I KNEW you could save us all. King Graham and Queen Valanice
 will be overjoyed to see you two.\" He claps his gnarled hands. \"I must
 run ahead to announce your arrival!\" The gnome spryly scampers toward
 the castle."
