"The life of a seaman has definitely taken its toll on this grizzled old
 sea dog. His skin is brown and cracked from years in the salty air, his
 voice rasps from too many smokes and too much rum, and he stoops from
 countless swabbings of countless decks. His clothes are none too clean,
 either."

 and you drop to the dock... dead."

 as he snarls, \"I'm warnin' ya, boy. I gots a tricky sword hand. Better
 go away afore I cain't stop meself!\""

%message 13
"\"That's it!\" he shouts. \"I warned ya to quit hangin' aroun'.\""
