"Gwydion is a lonely lad of seventeen who has lived for as long as he can
 remember with an evil and cruel wizard, by the name of Manannan.
 Gwydion gazes upon the countryside of Llewdor with longing, wishing
 he were free to leave. But, alas, such is not the case."

"Manannan treats the poor boy like his slave; ordering him about,
 constantly threatening him, and refusing to ever let him leave
 the premises. Often, Gwydion wonders who he really is, and how he came to
 live with the old wizard. But, Manannan offers no help in that area."

 \"GWYDION!!\" he shouts harshly."

"Oh, oh! Gwydion rushes to his side, afraid he may be in trouble. \"Why
 are you not WORKING, boy?\" the wizard sneers. Gwydion mumbles a
 faint reply. \"The kitchen floor is FILTHY!\" Manannan grumbles. \"Go
 sweep it. NOW!!\" Turning on his heel, the wizard re-enters the house,
 slamming the door behind him."

"Such is the story of young Gwydion's life to this point. What's a poor
 boy to do? Oh, well. In resignation, Gwydion obediently follows Manannan
 into the house."
