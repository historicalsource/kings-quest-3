"One of the trees has a light-green colored plant growing upon it. On
 closer inspection, you see that it's mistletoe."

%message 3
"The mistletoe hangs from the branches of the tree. There are a few dried
 sprigs mingled with the green mistletoe."

%message 4
"You search among the hanging mistletoe until you find a
 sprig that has dried. You break it off, and carry it with you."

"You are not close enough."

"%m9 You see a vessel tied up there now!"

%message 9

"You look out over the vast, blue-gray ocean. You wonder what lands and
 people reside across it. If only you could know!"

 %message 13
"You are standing atop a bluff overlooking the ocean, and see a village
 to the north. %m14 The trees here are stunted and twisted by
 strong ocean winds."

"The soft grass of the forest has been replaced by the
 coarse grass of the seashore."
