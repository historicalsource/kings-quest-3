"This is your own pitiful bed chamber. Compared to Manannan's
 fine room, yours is almost a cell. The bed is hard and
 uncomfortable with only a threadbare blanket and a small, flat pillow.
 The other furnishings are junk. But, as poor as it is,
 it's your own haven, as the wizard never enters it."

%message	2
"You are not close enough."

%message	3
"The bed is nothing more than a cot, hard and cold, and
 is difficult to sleep on. Your pillow is small, flat, and made of old rags."

%message	4
"You lean down and poke your head under the bed. You see nothing but
 cobwebs and dust."

%message	5
"You bend down and peek under the bed. Your possessions are still
 safely hidden."

%message	6
"Your dresser is a piece of junk. It's full of nicks and
 scratches, and one drawer is completely missing."

%message	7
"There is nothing you want there."

%message	8
"You hear a CLICK at the bedroom door. The old wizard has decided
 to free you by magically unlocking your door."

%message	9
"You have nothing of any interest in your dresser drawer."

%message	10
"You look into the cracked mirror hanging on the wall. Your
 reflection shows a tall, handsome lad dressed in dirty rags."

%message	11
"There's nothing under the bed."

%message	12
"You have always admired this lovely tapestry. It adds one of the few
 bright spots to this dreary house."

%message	13
"You lift the bottom of the tapestry and peer behind it. The wall is filled
 with cracks. You can see why Manannan would hang a tapestry here.
 (There are also dozens of charcoal- scribbled drawings, diagrams, maps, and
 notes to programmers, with the legend \"King's Quest IV,\" but you're
 uninterested in this, since you presently have your hands full with
 \"King's Quest III.\") You lower the tapestry and smooth out the wrinkles."

%message	14
"You twist the door knob on the bedroom door, but to your
 frustration, find it locked."

"The door is already open."

%message	16
"The door is already closed."

%message	17
"You start to close the door, but, so as not to arouse the wizard's
 suspicions, you leave it open."

%message	18
"You don't have a key that unlocks this door. It seems you are at
 the mercy of the miserable old wizard."

%message	19
"The door is not locked. It's not even closed!"

%message	20
"You have nothing with which to pick a lock."

%message	21
"How can you see it through your bedroom wall?"

%message	22
"You throw your body against the locked door, but in vain. The
 door is too strong for you to break."

%message	23
"That would do you no good. The wizard anticipated your escape and placed
 iron bars outside your window."

%message	24
"You get on your hands and knees and quickly shove all your
 possessions under the bed. They will be safe from the wizard's sharp
 eyes there."

%message	25
"Dropping to your knees, you reach under the bed and retrieve all of your
 possessions."

%message	26
"You lie down on your hard bed, stretch, then curl up,
 trying hard to get comfortable. Your thin blanket and small
 pillow do not help much."

%message	27
"Shhhh! You're trying to sleep."

%message	28
"You gratefully rise from your hard old bed, stretching your aching muscles."

%message	29
"The door is closed."

%message	30
"You suddenly find yourself in your own little room. You
 notice that the door is closed."

%message	31
"You might try that over there in your bedroom, but not here in the hall."

%message	32
"Obviously, you have nothing to hide, Gwydion!"

%message	33
"The hallway is uninteresting, except for the tapestry on the wall."

%message	34
"You get on your hands and knees and shove it under the bed. It will be
 safe from the wizard's sharp eyes there."

%message	35
"Dropping to your knees, you reach under the bed and retrieve it."

%message	36
"You drop down, reach under the bed, and then realize
 you've never put it there!"

%message	37
"The door is wide open."

%message	38
"You consider removing the dough pieces from your ears, but decide
 they are too fragile. You carefully comb your scraggly hair over them
 so the wizard cannot detect them."
